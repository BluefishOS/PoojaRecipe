             <h2>Ingredients</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Rice Flake</li>
                 <li>Green Chillies</li>
                 <li>Onions</li>
                 <li>Mustard seed</li>
                 <li>Cumin seeds</li>
                 <li>Curry Leaves</li>
                 <li>Peanuts</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Clean 1½ cups poha and add them to a large colander, strainer or bowl or pot. Please note that to make non sticky poha, you will need to use thick or medium flakes. If you use thin flakes poha will turn mushy after rinsing them.</li>
                 <li>You have to be quick at this step as doing it slowly will make them too mushy and soggy. Rinse them well with clean filtered water. Drain the water completely. Repeat the rinse & drain the water completely. I usually rinse them twice but if you feel they turn too mushy after the first rinse then stop rinsing further. Keep the bowl aside.</li>
                 <li>Meanwhile chop 1 medium sized onion and 1 to 2 green chilies. Also rinse the curry leaves and coriander leaves. Fine chop the coriander leaves. If you want to use potatoes then chop them to half inch cubes and keep them immersed in water until needed.</li>
                 <li>Check if poha has softened by pressing down a few flakes in between your thumb and fore finger. Run your finger across the flattened rice to break lumps if any. Poha would have absorbed water and softened in about 5 to 7 mins.</li>
                 <li>Heat a pan with ½ tablespoon oil and fry the peanuts until golden and crunchy. Set them aside for garnishing. This way the peanuts remain crunchy. You can also dry roast the peanuts if you prefer.</li>
             </ul>
